How to make your own LeslieMVC controllers!
-------------------------------------------

note that these custom psobjects created below for controllers will only allow *public* functions.
to create controllers with private functions, you will need to New-Module -AsCustomObject etc.
and then prefix your functions with private and place them in a seperate file to everything else...

 here is an example:
$ModuleController = New-Module -AsCustomObject -ScriptBlock {
    $Property = 'value'
    [string]$Other = 'Can be strongly typed'

    function private:MyMethod {
        'I do stuff!'
    }

}

And here is a relevant discussion on programmers.stackexchange.com about private methods in controllers... http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/198849/in-mvc-is-it-considered-good-practice-to-have-private-non-action-functions-in
